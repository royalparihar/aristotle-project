**Task 1**
 - Description : A question paper consists of sections. Each section contains multiple groups and each group
contains multiple questions. Each section could have optional groups, for example a student only
has to answer four groups from section 1 which has a total of 5 groups. While calculating total
marks, the student’s total would be the maximum of sum of any four groups in the above case. i.e;
Even if the student answers all groups, the sum of maximum four groups is the total mark for section.
Similarly, for the questions in a group. Design a data structure to store the data and write an
algorithm to compute a student’s total mark given the Question Paper Structure and Student Marks
Scheme(see below). You can refer to Question Max Marks Scheme to know what the maximum
mark of a question was as well . Remember that the student could have written all questions and all
groups but would only attain the total marks as per optional group/question structure.
- Assumption : Assuming that we have all the ques, groups and section data in our database and I am just showing the result which reflects the total marks which user input for every ques.
- All the logic for the given problem is described in utils.js file of task1 folder
